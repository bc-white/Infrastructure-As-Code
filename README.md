# Infrastructure-As-Code
This repository contains infrastructure as code items from my time as an engineer.

# Suggested Prerequisites

This repository assumes you will be launching the code from GitPod and also that you have a [Personal Configuration Repository](https://github.com/bc-white/Configurations) that accounts for standing up various tools like Terraform, AWS CLI, GCP CLI, and others. If you do not have this setup, you can initialize a fairly basic version of this repository from the [Gitpod Dotfiles Template Repository](https://github.com/gitpod-samples/demo-dotfiles-with-gitpod).

This repository launches a lightly customized Docker container that installs the latest Java to enable SonarQube to run scans.
